# ArqProject: Sentiment analysis service deployment using Docker container and Flasd-restful API
<p>From Linux terminal, run docker-compose up and wait for the container deployment. Run the bash script test_service.sh for demo output. Optionally, you can hit localhost:80 with a
JSON GET request. The NLP sentiment analysis model is a transformer network. The docker container is running on an Ubuntu:Bionic base image. Anaconda is installed on top of that and
a custom conda environment is created to run the NLP inference. </p>
